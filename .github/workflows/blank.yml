# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI/CD

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main", "dev" ]
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "dev" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  #   # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
